"""
Where to go next:
Care that both get a feasible sub problem
monday - trueday : Allow schedules where 5/6 and 1 is possible

all week: find pinwheel where density is between 5/6 and 1, and under 5/6

try to make pareto surface 10/6
assign each task a or b, 2 schedules for 2 instances 

schedule: task 1 to task k
          schedule just says there's those tasks.
          task 1 goes to a, task 2 to b, so on and so on

do by hand by sunday: find a loose 2 pinwheel example


below: thursday and friday
--
pareto surfaces not too interesting

could try finding graph way

pyton graph library - test for directed cycle

https://www.wild-inter.net/publications/html/gasieniec-smith-wild-2022.pdf.html#pf3

state graph - try to edge has passed, 2 tasks schedules - edge set different.
