        """this coe is unfinished - many iterations have been completed. The goal is to take the first schedule in the results list
        of lists and check if it has a possible partner by calculating the density of its companion. It will remove the value/s in question
        from the original schedule to check if its partner schedule is 5/6 or under. If it is then we search the results for this particular companion.
        Once this companion is found the resulting two lists will be placed into a tuple and stored to be printed as one possible solution later on
        
        So, find Length of current schedule, exclude all lengths that won't work. Exclude all results that won't have a pair.
        When pair is find, pop them from list, add them to separate list of lists which are the results. Pair them, [([a,b][c,d]).....]"""
