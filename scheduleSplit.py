"""
Where to go next:
Care that both get a feasible sub problem
Allow schedules where 5/6 and 1 is possible

find pinwheel where density is between 5/6 and 1, and under 5/6

try to make pareto surface 10/6
assign each task a or b, 2 schedules for 2 instances 

schedule: task 1 to task k
          schedule just says there's those tasks.
          task 1 goes to a, task 2 to b, so on and so on

find a loose 2 pinwheel example

pareto surfaces not too interesting

could try finding graph way
